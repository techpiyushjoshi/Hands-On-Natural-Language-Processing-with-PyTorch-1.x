**Build smart, AI-driven linguistic applications using deep learning and NLP techniques**

## What is this book about?
Developers working with NLP will be able to put their knowledge to work with this practical guide to PyTorch. You will learn to use PyTorch offerings and how to understand and analyze text using Python. You will learn to extract the underlying meaning in the text using deep neural networks and modern deep learning algorithms.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Use NLP technique for understanding, processing, and generating text
* Understand PyTorch, its applications and how it can be used to build deep linguistic models
* Explore the wide variety of deep learning architectures for NLP
* Develop the skills you need to process and represent both structured and unstructured NLP data
* Become well-versed with state-of-the-art technologies and exciting new developments in the NLP domain
* Create chatbots using attention-based neural networks

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
word_dict = {}
inverse_word_dict = {}

for i, word in enumerate(corpus):
   word_dict[word] = i
   inverse_word_dict[i] = word

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This PyTorch book is for NLP developers, machine learning and deep learning developers, and anyone interested in building intelligent language applications using both traditional NLP approaches and deep learning architectures. If youâ€™re looking to adopt modern NLP techniques and models for your development projects, this book is for you. Working knowledge of Python programming, along with basic working knowledge of NLP tasks, is required.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 2 - 8).
